## Localization

Changing text in the SDK is possible by overriding string resources on the native Android and
iOS layers.

### Android

To override a string resource for Android, you have to specify the string in your own strings.xml
file located in android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml. If the file is not present, create an
empty strings.xml file or copy it from
the [example app](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-flutter/tree/main/example/android/app/src/main/res/values).
In case your app supports multiple languages, please make sure to use the value directories (for
example values-nl-rNL).

You will find the general string resources of the
SDK [here](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-android/blob/main/ui-core/src/main/res/template/values/strings.xml.tt).
For overriding payment method specific strings,
please [search](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AAdyen%2Fadyen-android+strings.xml+language%3AXML&type=code&l=XML)
for the associated strings.xml file.

Copy and replace the string you want to override into your own strings.xml file. For adjusting the
names of the payment methods in Drop-In, please use
the [DropInConfiguration](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-flutter/blob/20895342c83d9888186fedc45d290c9390d58dc3/example/lib/screens/drop_in/drop_in_screen.dart#L142).

You can find more detailed information in the native Android
localization [documentation](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-android/blob/main/docs/UI_CUSTOMIZATION.md#overriding-string-resources).

### iOS

Overriding strings requires omitting the `shopperLocale` from the configuration on iOS. If a
`shopperLocale` is provided, the SDK uses the default string for that language.

In Xcode, create
a [new](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog#Add-a-string-catalog-to-your-project)
string catalog or use your existing one. Find the key for the string you want to override in
the [list of available strings](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-ios/blob/develop/Adyen/Assets/Generated/LocalizationKey.swift).

Copy and replace the string you want to override into the string catalog. For adjusting the
names of the payment methods in Drop-In, please use
the [DropInConfiguration](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-flutter/blob/20895342c83d9888186fedc45d290c9390d58dc3/example/lib/screens/drop_in/drop_in_screen.dart#L142).

You can find more detailed information in the native iOS
localization [documentation](https://adyen.github.io/adyen-ios/5.17.0/documentation/adyen/localization).
